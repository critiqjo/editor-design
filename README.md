# In search of a better editor design

It seems everyone is building their own special editor these days. I believe a
community should be involved from the design phase itself. Below, I will
illustrate some of the ideas I collected from various projects into making the
perfect editor for generations to come!! But that cannot be realized if _you_
are not involved! So after reading this, go to the issues page and start
ranting about the better design that you have!

## Vague Goals

- Robust
- Performant
- Lightweight
- Modular

## The Design

### File buffer management

[TODO]
